## Installation

I use pnpm and recommend in doing so too. If you don't want to modify the source code, it is fully compatible with every node package manager.

Install the package via

pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install node-widevine
```

npm:

```bash
npm install node-widevine
```

yarn:

```bash
yarn add node-widevine
```

## Examples

Example using bitmovin demo

```typescript
import { LicenseType, SERVICE_CERTIFICATE_CHALLENGE, Session } from "widevine";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

//read cdm files located in the same directory
const privateKey = readFileSync("./device_private_key");
const identifierBlob = readFileSync("./device_client_id_blob");

//pssh found in the mpd manifest
const pssh = Buffer.from(
  "AAAAW3Bzc2gAAAAA7e+LqXnWSs6jyCfc1R0h7QAAADsIARIQ62dqu8s0Xpa7z2FmMPGj2hoNd2lkZXZpbmVfdGVzdCIQZmtqM2xqYVNkZmFsa3IzaioCSEQyAA==",
  "base64"
);
//license url server
const licenseUrl = "https://cwip-shaka-proxy.appspot.com/no_auth";

const session = new Session({ privateKey, identifierBlob }, pssh);

const serviceCertificateResponse = await fetch(licenseUrl, {
  method: "POST",
  body: Buffer.from(SERVICE_CERTIFICATE_CHALLENGE)
});

const serviceCertificate = Buffer.from(await serviceCertificateResponse.arrayBuffer());
await session.setServiceCertificateFromMessage(serviceCertificate);

const response = await fetch(licenseUrl, {
  method: "POST",
  body: session.createLicenseRequest(LicenseType.STREAMING)
});

if (response.ok) {
  const successful = session.parseLicense(Buffer.from(await response.arrayBuffer())).length > 0;
  console.log(`successful? ${successful ? "yes" : "no"}`);
}
```

## Build

I use pnpm and if you don't want to change anything in the package.json, you have to install pnpm by using `npm -g install pnpm`

#### Code

Just run `pnpm build` to generate the js, map and type definition files from the Typescript source.

#### Protocol Buffers

If you want to compile the license_protocol.ts file yourself, you need to run `pnpm proto:compile`

Warning: You need to replace the import statement `import _m0 from "protobufjs/minimal";` in the license_protocol.ts file with `import _m0 from "protobufjs/minimal.js";` (add the .js extension) or else it will throw an error.

## License Stuff
